Bootstrap Extensions Github Pages
=================================

Getting Started
---------------

Get a local copy of the `gh-pages` branch:

```bash
cd bootstrap-extensions
git checkout gh-pages
```

In order to get a development server up quickly, installing the [Jekyll][jekyll] gem is required. To avoid messing up with you system gems, I use [RVM][rvm]; and to never forget a dependency, I recommend using [Bundler][bundler]. That's much more easy than it seems:

```
# Let RVM create a gemset for you
cd . # RVM will ask you if you want to trust the .rvmrc, answer: Y(es)

# Install Jekyll with Bundler
bundle install

# Start the Jekyll server
jekyll --server
```

You server is up at [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).
