Bootstrap Extensions
====================

Some CSS classes which extend [Bootstrap][bootstrap].

**Notice**: Our Bootstrap extensions have moved and they are now [maintained by Acid Labs][acidlabs]. I'll be pleased to receive your contributions on [this new repository][acidlabs-be].

Conventions
-----------

Following the Bootstrap conventions, all extension classes are named upon their _base_ class name. In order to avoid any conflict in the future, I also prepend the custom classes names with `custom`.

**Example**: `.custom-form-actions-bordered` extends `.form-actions` and should be used as follow:

```css
<div class="form-actions custom-form-actions-bordered"> ... </div>
```

See more [documentation and examples][pages] at the project pages.

Some of these extensions were crafted during my work time at [Acid Labs][acidlabs]. Thanks for that!

Of course, the Bootstrap name and badge are property of Twitter.
